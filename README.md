VIRTUAL IMAGE:
This code implements a simple virtual pet simulation using Pygame. The player interacts with three buttons (representing food and a toy) to feed or entertain the virtual pet. The pet's health and happiness increase when buttons are clicked, and the game tracks the total playtime. The background image and button positions are displayed in a Pygame window, offering a basic foundation for a virtual pet game
